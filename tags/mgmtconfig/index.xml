      <title>A new sync primitive in golang</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lots of new stuff in mgmt and I had a synchronization problem that needed solving&amp;hellip; Long story short, I built it into a piece of re-usable functionality, exactly like you might find in the sync package. For details and examples, please continue reading&amp;hellip;
The Problem:
I want to multicast a signal to an arbitrary number of goroutines. As you might already know, this can already be done with a chan struct{}.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent about four years at Red Hat, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on&amp;hellip;
TL;DR: had to leave Red Hat and start Patreon to fund mgmt.
What follows is a bit of historical rambling, and some forward looking statements.
Retrospective:
Long-time readers of my blog will know that I was very active in the puppet ecosystem for many years. I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</description>

      <title>Mgmt Configuration Language</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2018/02/05/mgmt-configuration-language/</link>

      <description>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.

 An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, we recently re-licensed mgmt from the AGPL (Affero General Public License) to the regular GPL. This is a post explaining the decision and which hopefully includes some insights at the intersection of technology and legal issues.

      <title>Declarative vs. Imperative paradigms</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/05/05/declarative-vs-imperative-paradigms/</link>

      <description>Recently, while operating two different remote-controlled appliances, I realized that it was high time for a discussion about declarative and imperative paradigms. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by looking at the two remotes:
Two different &amp;ldquo;remotes&amp;rdquo;. The one on the left operates a television, and the one on the right controls a central heating and cooling system.At first glance you will notice that one of these remotes is dark, and the other is light.</description>

      <title>Metaparameters in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/03/01/metaparameters-in-mgmt/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2017/03/01/metaparameters-in-mgmt/</guid>
      <description>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.
In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</description>

      <title>Faster golang builds</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &amp;ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&amp;rdquo;.
Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:
The compiler
Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</description>

      <title>Send/Recv in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/12/07/sendrecv-in-mgmt/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/12/07/sendrecv-in-mgmt/</guid>
      <description>I previously published &amp;ldquo;A revisionist history of configuration management&amp;rdquo;. I meant for that to be the intro to this article, but it ended up being long enough that it deserved a separate post. I will explain Send/Recv in this article, but first a few clarifications to the aforementioned article.
Clarifications
I mentioned that my &amp;ldquo;revisionist history&amp;rdquo; was inaccurate, but I failed to mention that it was also not exhaustive! Many things were left out either because they were proprietary, niche, not well-known, of obscure design or simply for brevity.</description>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/11/30/a-revisionist-history-of-configuration-management/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&amp;rsquo;d like to start with some background.
History
This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&amp;rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.
Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&amp;rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</description>

      <title>Remote execution in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/10/07/remote-execution-in-mgmt/</link>

      <guid>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/10/07/remote-execution-in-mgmt/</guid>
      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.
Prior knowledge
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <description>The mgmt config project got a logo! The full commit is here. Thanks to Sarah Jane Cox for creating it.
 Happy Hacking,

      <title>Automatic clustering in mgmt</title>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.
Foreword:
Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to tell you that I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about mgmt in Hong Kong and South Africa. It will be my first time to both countries and my first time to Asia and Africa!
In Hong Kong I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking at HKOSCon2016.
In South Africa I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking at DebConf16.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to meeting with many of the hard-working Debian hackers, and collaborating with them to build and promote excellent Free Software.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.
Resources in a graph
Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two months since I announced mgmt, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to continue the story by telling you more about the design of what&amp;rsquo;s now in git master. Before I get into those details, let me quickly recap what&amp;rsquo;s happened since then.
Mgmt community recap:
 I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of golang lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve hit painful problems in the past. Here are some debugging tips. Hopefully they help you out. I bet you don&amp;rsquo;t know #2.
#0 Use log.Printf:
This should go without saying, but I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to say it&amp;rsquo;s what I use the most. We&amp;rsquo;ve only been C programming for 44+ years, and it&amp;rsquo;s still what is most useful!
#1 Use go run -race:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.
I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>
