      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &amp;ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&amp;rdquo;.
Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:
The compiler
Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</description>

      <description>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</description>
