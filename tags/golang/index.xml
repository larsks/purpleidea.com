      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school cool. Real hackers chat on open, distributed platforms. Most technical discussion can be found on the Freenode IRC network. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but the advantages clearly outweigh the drawbacks.
Recently, I needed to join an existing large &amp;ldquo;community&amp;rdquo; on the centralized, proprietary walled garden that is the Slack network.
The Problem:
Connecting to the the Slack server requires that you use either the proprietary client or their proprietary web app.</description>

      <title>A new sync primitive in golang</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on lots of new stuff in mgmt and I had a synchronization problem that needed solving&amp;hellip; Long story short, I built it into a piece of re-usable functionality, exactly like you might find in the sync package. For details and examples, please continue reading&amp;hellip;
The Problem:
I want to multicast a signal to an arbitrary number of goroutines. As you might already know, this can already be done with a chan struct{}.</description>

      <title>Faster golang builds</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &amp;ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&amp;rdquo;.
Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:
The compiler
Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</description>

      <title>Remote execution in mgmt</title>
      <link>https://purpleidea.com/blog/2016/10/07/remote-execution-in-mgmt/</link>

      <description>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&amp;rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.
Prior knowledge
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</description>

      <description>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&amp;rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.
In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.
Foreword:
Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&amp;rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &amp;ldquo;automatic grouping&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;AutoGroup&amp;rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&amp;rsquo;s also an introductory video.
Resources in a graph
Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot of golang lately. I&amp;rsquo;ve hit painful problems in the past. Here are some debugging tips. Hopefully they help you out. I bet you don&amp;rsquo;t know #2.
#0 Use log.Printf:
This should go without saying, but I&amp;rsquo;m ashamed to say it&amp;rsquo;s what I use the most. We&amp;rsquo;ve only been C programming for 44+ years, and it&amp;rsquo;s still what is most useful!
#1 Use go run -race:</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret to the readers of this blog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been active in the configuration management space for some time. I owe most of my knowledge to what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned while working with Puppet and from other hackers working in and around various other communities.
I&amp;rsquo;ve published, a number, of articles, in an, attempt, to push, the field, forwards, and to, share the, knowledge, that I&amp;rsquo;ve, learned, with others. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking in golang for a while, but I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get too deep into some of the language nuances until more recently. Since some of them have started to bite me, here&amp;rsquo;s a little post-mortem of one of the problems I was having.
After hacking and testing code all day, I made a seemingly innocuous change, and when running my program, I saw the following error:</description>
