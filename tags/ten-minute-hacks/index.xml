      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m old school and still rocking an old X220 laptop because I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the new ones. My battery life isn&amp;rsquo;t as great as I&amp;rsquo;d like it to be, but it gets worse when some &amp;ldquo;webapp&amp;rdquo; (which I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have as a native GTK+ app) causes Firefox to rev my CPU with their websocket (hi gmail!) poller.
This seems to happen most often on planes or when I&amp;rsquo;m disconnected from the internet.</description>

      <description>I was stuck on a 14 hour flight last week, and to my disappointment, only one of the two headphone speakers were working. The plane&amp;rsquo;s media centre has an audio connector that looks like this:
 Someone should consider probing this USB port.The hole to the left is smaller than a 3.5mm headphone jack, and designed for a proprietary headphone connector that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have, and the two holes to the right are part of a different proprietary connector which match with the cheap airline headphones to provide the left and right audio channels.</description>
