      <description>If you like my blog, and you like my code, please leave me a tip!
Funds and other resources give me more time to spend on code and articles for you!
I&amp;rsquo;m often in need of hardware, so if you have something you can donate or sponsor, please let me know.
If your company wants to fly me somewhere to come hack on my code in your office, that could be arranged.</description>

      <description>Their telephone operator usually sounds very unhappy, but their pizza is fairly good. Ask them not to burn it! I recommend the &amp;ldquo;cheese and tomato&amp;rdquo;, aka plain. Tell them The Technical Blog of James sent you.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the most recent menu:
     I posted this because there&amp;rsquo;s no menu to be found online.
Happy Hacking!</description>

      <description>My favourite piece of piano music is called &amp;ldquo;Dorothy&amp;rdquo; by &amp;ldquo;Seymour Smith&amp;rdquo;. My grandmother [1] used to play it to me when I was young. When she died, I asked if I could keep the piano music.
If you know anything about Seymour Smith, have a copy of any of his sheet music, or would like to send me a recording of Dorothy of any of his other music, please contact me.</description>

      <title>The Technical CAPTCHA</title>

      <description>This was intended to be a CAPTCHA for recruiters.
The CAPTCHA  Comment or write a question on one of my technical articles. Contact me. If your comment was good, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a reply back!  It need not be long, but you do get points for cleverness if it asks an interesting question, or makes light of a fun corner case that I haven&amp;rsquo;t covered. The clever part about this, is that you get to think of it as a way of quizzing me, and I get to engage with people whose interest is technology.</description>

      <description>An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs. – Nico Habermann </description>
