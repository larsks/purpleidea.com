	<hr>
	<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve learned about many of the advantages of using a modern terminal and shell. I&rsquo;m talking about using bash with GNOME terminal on a modern GNU/Linux distribution.
I particularly like switching between the terminal and GUI applications. It&rsquo;s now even better.
Automatic Hyperlinks:
Occasionally, some program running in your shell might output what looked like a link:
 gnome terminal and vte will automatically add links to text that looks like a web hyperlink or an email addressThey can be seen when you hover over them, and a right-click will display a useful context menu:</p>

		<small>how to use Slack via IRC since the gateway closed...</small>
	</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>I&rsquo;m old school cool. Real hackers chat on open, distributed platforms. Most technical discussion can be found on the Freenode IRC network. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but the advantages clearly outweigh the drawbacks.
Recently, I needed to join an existing large &ldquo;community&rdquo; on the centralized, proprietary walled garden that is the Slack network.
The Problem:
Connecting to the the Slack server requires that you use either the proprietary client or their proprietary web app.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve spent about four years at Red Hat, and now it&rsquo;s time to move on&hellip;
TL;DR: had to leave Red Hat and start Patreon to fund mgmt.
What follows is a bit of historical rambling, and some forward looking statements.
Retrospective:
Long-time readers of my blog will know that I was very active in the puppet ecosystem for many years. I learned a lot while writing puppet code, and while building some of my outrageous puppet hacks.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>Mgmt has given us a lot of great features, demos, and insight into how infrastructure automation should be managed. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t a complete tool yet, because it was missing a crucial piece for its completeness. That all changes today with the addition of: the language.

 An ideal language allows us to express easily what is useful for the programming task, and at the same time makes it difficult to write what leads to incomprehensible or incorrect programs.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>In mgmt we have meta parameters. They are similar in concept to what you might be familiar with from other tools, except that they are more clearly defined (in a single struct) and vastly more powerful.
In mgmt, a meta parameter is a parameter which is codified entirely in the engine, and which can be used by any resource. In contrast with Puppet, require/before are considered meta parameters, whereas in mgmt, the equivalent is a graph edge, which is not a meta parameter.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve been hacking in golang since before version 1.4, and the speed at which my builds finished has been mostly trending downwards. Let&rsquo;s look into the reasons and some fixes. TL;DR click-bait title: &ldquo;Get 4x faster golang builds with this one trick!&rdquo;.
Here are the three reasons my builds got slower:
The compiler
Before version 1.5, the compiler was written in C but with that release, it moved to being pure golang.</p>

I will explain Send/Recv in this article, but first a few clarifications to the aforementioned article.
Clarifications
I mentioned that my &ldquo;revisionist history&rdquo; was inaccurate, but I failed to mention that it was also not exhaustive! Many things were left out either because they were proprietary, niche, not well-known, of obscure design or simply for brevity.</p>

	<p>I&rsquo;ve got a brand new core feature in mgmt called send/recv which I plan to show you shortly, but first I&rsquo;d like to start with some background.
History
This is my historical perspective and interpretation about the last twenty years in configuration management. It&rsquo;s likely inaccurate and slightly revisionist, but it should be correct enough to tell the design story that I want to share.
Sometime after people started to realize that writing bash scripts wasn&rsquo;t a safe, scalable, or reusable way to automate systems, CFEngine burst onto the scene with the first real solution to this problem.</p>

	<hr>
	<p>Bootstrapping a cluster from your laptop, or managing machines without needing to first setup a separate config management infrastructure are both very reasonable and fundamental asks. I was particularly inspired by Ansible&rsquo;s agent-less remote execution model, but never wanted to build a centralized orchestrator. I soon realized that I could have my ice cream and eat it too.
Prior knowledge
If you haven&rsquo;t read the earlier articles about mgmt, then I recommend you start with those, and then come back here.</p>

	<p>In mgmt, deploying and managing your clustered config management infrastructure needs to be as automatic as the infrastructure you&rsquo;re using mgmt to manage. With mgmt, instead of a centralized data store, we function as a distributed system, built on top of etcd and the raft protocol.
In this article, I&rsquo;ll cover how this feature works.

Mgmt is a next generation configuration management project. If you haven&rsquo;t heard of it yet, or you don&rsquo;t remember why we use a distributed database, start by reading the previous articles:</p>

	<p>I have a GNU/Linux server which I mount a few LUKS encrypted drives on. I only ever interact with the server over SSH, and I never want to keep the LUKS credentials on the remote server. I don&rsquo;t have anything especially sensitive on the drives, but I think it&rsquo;s a good security practice to encrypt it all, if only to add noise into the system and for solidarity with those who harbour much more sensitive data.</p>

	<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll tell you about the recently released &ldquo;automatic grouping&rdquo; or &ldquo;AutoGroup&rdquo; feature in mgmt, a next generation configuration management prototype. If you aren&rsquo;t already familiar with mgmt, I&rsquo;d recommend you start by reading the introductory post, and the second post. There&rsquo;s also an introductory video.
Resources in a graph
Most configuration management systems use something called a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. This is a fancy way of saying that it is a bunch of circles (vertices) which are connected with arrows (edges).</p>

Mgmt community recap:
 I gave the first public presentation about mgmt at CfgMgmtCamp. I repeated the talk at DevConf.cz. The video recording is available. Felix wrote about his work cross compiling puppet code to mgmt.</p>

I&rsquo;ve spent many nights thinking about these problems, but it is not without some chagrin that I realized that the current state-of-the-art in configuration management cannot easily (or elegantly) solve all the problems for which I wish to write solutions.</p>

Secondly, when hacking on projects that have a long initial setup phase (eg: a long rpm install) it would be excellent if hackers could roll their own modified base boxes, so that certain common operations could be re-factored out into the base image.</p>

I only started publicly groaning about this missing feature in 2013, and mcrha finally patched it. I tested the feature and found a small bug, mcrha patched that too, and I finally re-tested it. Now I&rsquo;m blogging about this process so that you can get involved too!</p>

Feel free to check out: https://pdfdoc-purpleidea.rhcloud.com/ This is a simple app that takes the URL of a markdown file on GitHub, and outputs a pandoc converted PDF. I wanted to use pandoc specifically, because it produces PDF&rsquo;s that were beautifully created with LaTeX.</p>

	<p>Configuration management is an essential part of securing your infrastructure because it can make sure that it is set up correctly. It is essential that configuration management only enhance security, and not weaken it. Unfortunately, the status-quo of secret management in puppet is pretty poor.
In the worst (and most common) case, plain text passwords are found in manifests. If the module author tried harder, sometimes these password strings are pre-hashed (and sometimes salted) and fed directly into the consumer.</p>

R.I.&rsquo;s hack lets you store hiera data inside a puppet module. This can have many uses including letting you throw out the nested mess that is commonly params.pp, and replace it with something file based that is elegant and hierarchical.</p>

	<p>This is a quick trick for making working with git submodules more magic.
One day you might find that using git submodules is needed for your project. It&rsquo;s probably not necessary for everyday hacking, but if you&rsquo;re glue-ing things together, it can be quite useful. Puppet-Gluster uses this technique to easily include all the dependencies needed for a Puppet-Gluster+Vagrant automatic deployment.
If you&rsquo;re a good hacker, you develop things in separate feature branches.</p>

	<p>Some fun updates for vagrant hackers&hellip; I wanted to use the venerable clustered SSH (cssh) and screen with vagrant. I decided to expand on my vsftp script. First read:  Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt
 and  Vagrant vsftp and other tricks
 to get up to speed on the background information.
Vagrant screen:
First, a simple screen hack&hellip; I often use my vssh alias to quickly ssh into a machine, but I don&rsquo;t want to have to waste time with sudo-ing to root and then running screen each time.</p>

	<p>As I previously wrote, I&rsquo;ve been busy with Vagrant on Fedora with libvirt, and have even been submitting, patches and issues! (This &ldquo;closed&rdquo; issue needs solving!) Here are some of the tricks that I&rsquo;ve used while hacking away.
Default provider:
I should have mentioned this in my earlier article but I forgot: If you&rsquo;re always using the same provider, you might want to set it as the default. In my case I&rsquo;m using vagrant-libvirt.</p>

	<p>Apparently lots of people are using Vagrant these days, so I figured I&rsquo;d try it out. I wanted to get it working on Fedora, and without Virtualbox. This is an intro article on Vagrant, and what I&rsquo;ve done. I did this on Fedora 19. Feel free to suggest improvements.
Intro:
Vagrant is a tool that easily provisions virtual machines, and then kicks off a configuration management deployment like Puppet. It&rsquo;s often used for development.</p>

	<p>As a follow-up to my original article on recursion in Puppet, and in my attempt to Push Puppet (to its limit), I&rsquo;ll now attempt some more advanced recursion techniques in Puppet.
In my original recursion example, the type does recurse, but the callee cannot return any value to the caller because it is a type, and not strictly a function. This limitation immediately limits the usefulness of this technique, but I&rsquo;ll try to press on!</p>

	<p>Ironically, one of the reasons that I started writing Puppet code, was so that I could spend more time designing and building, and less time writing documentation. I suppose I&rsquo;m a victim of my success, because Puppet-Gluster has grown large enough to warrant its own documentation.
So I gave in, and put together some documentation.
It&rsquo;s available as markdown, and, also as a pdf. As before, there is an examples/ directory which you might want to use as additional reference.</p>

	</h4>
	<hr>
	<p>People often ask how to do iteration in Puppet. Most Puppet users have a background in imperative programming, and are already very familiar with for loops. Puppet is sometimes confusing at first, because it is actually (or technically, contains) a declarative, domain-specific language. In general, DSL&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t always Turing complete, nor do they need to support loops, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t iterate.
Until recently, Puppet didn&rsquo;t have an explicit looping construct, and it is quite possible to build complex modules without using this new construct.</p>

I hope you enjoyed my &ldquo;Pushing Puppet (to its limit)&rdquo; talk and demos from Puppet Camp D.C., LISA 2013. As requested, I&rsquo;ve posted the code and slides.
Here is the code: https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-pushing
This module will require three modules as dependencies. The dependencies are:  My Puppet-Common module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-common My Puppet-Runonce module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-runonce My Puppet-FSM module https://github.com/purpleidea/puppet-fsm  Each example doesn&rsquo;t require all the dependencies, so if you&rsquo;re only interested in the FSM, you only need that module.</p>

	<p>Oh, hi there.
In case you&rsquo;re interested, I&rsquo;ve just made a first release of my puppet-shorewall module. This isn&rsquo;t meant as an exhaustive shorewall module, but it does provide most of the usual functionality that most users need.
In particular, it&rsquo;s the module dependency that I use for many of my other puppet modules that provide firewalling. This is probably where you&rsquo;re most likely to consume it.
In general most modules just implement shorewall::rule, so if you really don&rsquo;t want to use this code, you can implement that signature yourself, or not use automatic firewalling.</p>

	<p>Hey there,
I&rsquo;ve done a bit of puppet-gluster hacking lately to try to squeeze some extra features and testing in before Linuxcon. Here&rsquo;s a short list:  SELinux fixes to keep Dan Walsh happy :) Ping and status checks before volume creation. Now puppet-gluster will be less noisy about failures or missing executions that are due to the necessary incremental nature of puppet-gluster runs. You&rsquo;ll need multiple puppet runs to get a complete setup, so don&rsquo;t let puppet complain part way through.</p>

	<p>I love tabs, they&rsquo;re so much easier to work with, but YAML doesn&rsquo;t like them. I&rsquo;m constantly adding them in accidentally, and puppet&rsquo;s error message is a bit cryptic:
Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 400 on SERVER: malformed format string - %S at /etc/puppet/manifests/foo.pp:18 on node bar.example.com  This happens during a puppet run, which in my case loads up YAML files. The tricky part was that the error wasn&rsquo;t at all related to the foo.</p>
